= Rademacher Workdir Template

To use it, you need to have the prerequisites for Yocto fulfilled and additionally `docbook2x` installed.

== Getting the source

Create yourself a bsp directory with a sources subdirectory in it and clone the source repositories as well as the workdir template

[source,console]
$ mkdir -p rdm-community-bsp/sources
$ cd rdm-community-bsp
$ git clone --branch jethro https://github.com/rdm-dev/yocto-curie-workdir.git rdm-yocto-workdir
$ cd sources
$ for rep in poky meta-openembedded meta-fsl-arm meta-fsl-arm-extra meta-fsl-demos meta-browser meta-cpan meta-java meta-jens; do \
  git clone --branch jethro https://github.com/rdm-dev/${rep}; done

== Preparing your environment

Append `. ~/rdm-community-bsp/sources/meta-jens/scripts/bashrc` to your `.bashrc`, plus `. ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc` if you want use https://github.com/rehsack/Packager-Utils to manage `meta-cpan`.

Create yourself a `${HOME}/.oe` directory for local extension to `oe_builddir` and place two files in it:

`${HOME}/.oe/init`::

[source,shell]
__oe_prepend_path "`dirname ${OEROOT}`/meta-jens/scripts"
__oe_append_extrawhite "WANTED_ROOT_DEV"

`${HOME}/.oe/down`::

[source,shell]
__oe_remove_path "`dirname ${OEROOT}`/meta-jens/scripts"
__oe_remove_extrawhite "WANTED_ROOT_DEV"

Now source `. ~/rdm-community-bsp/sources/meta-jens/scripts/bashrc` manually, `exec bash -l` or whatever you need to apply the environmental changes.

== Start first build

[source,console]
$ oe_builddir use ~/rdm-community-bsp/rdm-yocto-workdir
$ mkimgs rdm-xbmc-image
